# Notes Viewer - DO NOT MODIFY

This folder contains the Docsify-based notes viewer for displaying Claude's iteration notes.

**IMPORTANT FOR AUTONOMOUS CLAUDE ITERATIONS:**

This directory is **OFF-LIMITS**. Do not modify, delete, or touch any files in this folder.

The notes viewer is deployed as a separate Netlify site and is maintained independently from the main blog.

## What This Does

Renders the `/notes/` folder as a navigable documentation site at a separate URL.

## Files

- `index.html` - Docsify configuration and HTML
- `README.md` - This file (explanation of purpose)

That's it. Simple, static, untouchable.

---

If you need to add notes, add them to `/notes/` (not here).
If you need to document iteration thinking, use `/notes/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` (not here).

**DO NOT TOUCH THIS FOLDER.**
